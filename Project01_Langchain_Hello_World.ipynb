Also, everyone is a little different, so we'll break this down into some general guidelines, and you can adjust based on your experience and fitness level.\n",

            "*   **Warm-up:** Always start with 5-10 minutes of light cardio (like jogging or jumping jacks) and dynamic stretching (arm circles, torso twists, chest stretches) before your workout. This prepares your muscles and joints.\n",
            "*   **Cool-down:** Finish each workout with 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 20-30 seconds), focusing on your chest, shoulders, and triceps. This helps with flexibility and recovery.\n",
            "*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel pain, stop the exercise and rest. Don't push through pain.\n",
            "*   **Progressive Overload:** As you get stronger, gradually increase the weight, reps, sets, or difficulty of the exercise. This challenges your muscles and encourages growth.\n",
            "*   **Nutrition and Rest:** Remember that good nutrition and sufficient rest (7-9 hours of sleep) are just as important as working out. Muscles grow during rest.\n",
            "*   **Proper Form Over Weight:** Focus on maintaining proper form through the full range of motion. Don't use weight that makes your form break down. It's better to lift lighter with good form than to lift heavy with bad form.\n",
